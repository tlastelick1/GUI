# GUI
Experimenting with different GUI features and functionality.

This application recieves keyboard input into a textBox; two labels keep track of the words and characters typed into the textbox and the counts are displayed. There is a button that allows the user to 'clear' the textbox of all text and reset the label counts back to 0. There is another button that exits the program. Both of these buttons temporarily light up upon being clicked. All components are initialized in the constructor and therefore the full functionality of the program will start everytime a TextAnalyzer object is initialized. 

Detailed descriptions of class features and function applications located at the top of each file.
